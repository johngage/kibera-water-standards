The **Kibera Water Research Group** has been a center of excellence for water quality research, teaching, and practice since its founding in 2010.

see [Kiberawater.com](https://kiberawater.com)

Before this coming Tuesday, we will hold initial meetings with our collaborators at SHOFCO, Kibera Town Centre, Carolina for Kibera, and KDI to discuss a common approach to the new administration of Nairobi City-County, and of Kenya. 

Our goal is to unite all those who provide the water supply of Kibera:

- Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company
- All water vendors
- All borehole operators
- All bowser sources
- All sanitation vendors
- All distribution networks
- Beverage and bottled water retailers
