The **Kibera Water Services Providers Coalition** is a center of excellence for rebuilding Kibera water services. We focus on training, testing, water quality research, and practical support for every water service provider in Kibera. We are establishing the Kibera Water Standards Association to bring all water in Kibera to international standards. 

see [Kiberawater.com](https://kiberawater.com)

This Friday, September 9, 2022, we will hold initial meetings with our collaborators at SHOFCO, Kibera Town Centre, Carolina for Kibera, and KDI to discuss a common approach to the new administrations of Nairobi City-County and of Kenya. All members of the Kibera Water Vendors Association, the Kibera Sanitation Services Association, and all those providing water services to Kibera are welcome.

Our goal is to unite all those who provide the water supply of Kibera in creating a common agenda with agreed-upon common areas of agreement as we seek new resources for Kibera. 

- Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company
- Water vendors
- Tank and distribution pipe owners
- Borehole operators
- Bowser sources
- Sanitation vendors
- Water distribution networks
- Water bottlers
- Beverage and bottled water retailers
- Restaurants, bars and cafes
- Schools
- Churches and mosques
- Suppliers of water engineering, water equipment, and water training and education

Each group has its own resources, its own finances, its own methods and procedures, and its own way of interacting with the other groups. But we all share a common interest: providing our children with clean, healthy water.

To that end, we propose a set of common actions and new financial resources to improve the ability of *all* groups to *provide* clean water, *rebuild* Kiberan infrastructure, *train* a new generation of water providers, *upgrade* all equipment, and *make water in Kibera clean and affordable by all*
