# If we organize, we can act together to make Kibera water safe for our children
- It is the moment to join Nairobi City/County and the new national Ministries in a common agenda to improve all of our services
## Can we overcome commercial rivalries and long-standing differences about who profits from selling water in Kibera? 
## Can we build a working relationship with Narobi Water and Sewerage?
## Where will we find the money to upgrade our tanks, our pipes, and our testing?
