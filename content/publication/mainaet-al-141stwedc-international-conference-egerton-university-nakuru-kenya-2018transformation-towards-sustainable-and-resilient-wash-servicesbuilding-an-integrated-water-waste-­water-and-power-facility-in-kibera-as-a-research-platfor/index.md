abstract: "The Kibera Town Centre [KTC]has provided water and waste water
  treatment in the Kibera slum of Nairobi since July, 2014. This paper outlines
  the operational and engineering successes and failures in this four-year
  period, and describes the design, implementation, and operation of a real-time
  data acquisition system to support both operations and research. A primary
  research objective is to evaluate new technologies suitable for total potable
  reuse in a slum setting, inviting collaboration in the design of water quality
  sensors and data analysis systems. "
